    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>    I currently hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with a concentration in Finance, after 7 years in the industry
          I decided to enroll in a Coding Bootcamp where I received a certificate in in Full Stack Software Development from Bottega University.
          Upon completion of the bootcamp I enrolled into the MSSD program at Boston University. My current goal is to become a software developer in a company that aligns with 
          my values and hobbies, such as art, education, personal training, and nature and wildlife. What my ultimate goal in my life is to create a software company that will be of great benefit to the society at large, and it would gain a strong following and usage where I could start charging for subscriptions for usage. 
          This is one of my primary goals for my career.
